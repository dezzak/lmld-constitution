Notes on this Model Constitution

This model constitution is recommended to Local Parties in England, to be adapted as necessary to suit local circumstances.

The symbol (...) indicates a suitable value to be fixed by the Local Party. Defaults are defined below.

Words and sections in square brackets [...] are optional and Local Parties may choose to include or omit them, subject to the requirements detailed below. By default they are all included (with the first alternatives in Sections 6.4, 7.2(h), 8.5, 8.5(e), 9.1, 9.3 and 9.5), except the words in square brackets in 10.5 are not included).

If amended, the document adopted should be forwarded to the Regional Party to confirm that it conforms with the Party Constitution. There are some sections, indicated below, where variation is likely to conflict with the Party Constitution.

1,2. Name and Definitions

The name should be taken from the constituency, and may optionally include the word “Constituency” or “Local”.

A Local Party covering more than one constituency will wish to choose a suitable form for its name, to define the several constituencies. Changes throughout this constitution are necessary to reflect such a Local Party’s multi-constituency structure.

Otherwise the definitions should not be changed.

3. Objects

Should not be subtracted from, but Local Parties might wish to add additional objects, for instance the provision of social facilities for members.
Particular care should be taken to include the names of all predecessor Liberal Associations which may have rights under the rules or constitutions of external bodies.

4. Membership

Should not generally be changed. The powers of the Executive Committee might be reduced or transferred to General Meetings.

5. Officers and Executive Committee

Every Local Party must have a Chair and a Treasurer, which is a legal requirement under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act.  The same person cannot combine the offices of Chair and Treasurer.  Each Local Party must also have a Data Officer, in order to operate the Party’s membership system satisfactorily. This Model Constitution does not allow for the same person to be elected to more than one office, but small Local Parties (e.g. with less than 100 members) wishing to combine offices may with the agreement of their Region amend the Model.  If a Local Party finds it impossible to elect five separate people to fill the offices, it may co-opt one of the officers to do a second job, except that the Chair and Treasurer must be separate people at all times

Local Parties might decide to:
(a) elect extra officers, e.g. Social Secretary, Press Officer, Equal Opportunities Officer;
(b) remove the casting vote of the Chair, or to give the Chair a casting vote only;
(c) dispense with the Honorary Office of President.

Local Parties should fix the scale of Branch, direct, Councillor and Youth/Student representation on the Executive Committee on an equitable basis and to accord with local circumstances. Either the number of direct representatives (b), or representatives per Branch (c) must be sufficient to enable fair representation of opinions within the Local Party. A minimum of 6 is recommended in one class. Unless the Local Party has a small number of large wards/branches the larger number would be in class (b).

The default numbers in Section 5.3 are 10 in (b), 1 and 2 in (c), 1 each in (e) and (g) and 3 in
(f). The relevant County and District/Borough/Unitary Council names should be inserted in (e) and (f). If the Local Party area covers more than one District/Borough, each Council group may be represented separately or jointly, depending on local circumstances. Section 5.3 (e) may be dispensed with where there is no County Council.

The list of categories of Executive Committee members should not be subtracted from, but may be increased in special circumstances.

If there are Ordinary Members the number of co-opted Members in 5.4 may not be more than the number of Ordinary Members. If there are no Ordinary Members then the Local Party must determine the maximum number of co-opted Members. The default number is ten.

The Executive Committee is required to meet at least quarterly. More frequent (e.g. monthly) meetings may be appropriate. If the Executive Committee only meets quarterly, it might be appropriate to provide for a “Finance and General Purposes Committee”, by whatever name is preferred, with specific make-up and powers, to meet more often.

6. Elections

Most changes to the provisions for election and holding office would conflict with the Federal Constitution. Elections can be by postal ballot of all members or by the members present at the AGM. The same method of election should be used for Officers and Ordinary Members.

Local Parties should appoint a person who is a not candidate, a close relative of a candidate or the proposer or seconder of a candidate (“a disinterested person”) as Returning Officer.  Local Parties anticipating contested elections may wish to ask their Region to nominate a person from outside the Local Party to act as Returning Officer.

The election rules referred to in section 6.7 are those approved by Federal Conference for the Federal Party Committee elections every two years and can be found in the full versions of the Party Constitution on the party website. Every candidate in a contested election should be provided with the rules by the Returning Officer within 24 hours of the close of nominations.
If a Local Party chooses to supplement these rules with its own additions these    should be agreed by a General Meeting of members.
No variation from the rules or Returning Officers rulings shall be made without them being copied to all candidates in the election at the same time.

7. General Meetings

Most changes would conflict with the Federal Constitution. Provisions could be added, notice periods could be lengthened or a large Local Party might decide to raise the required quorum.

8. Local Branches

It is for the Local Party to decide whether it wishes to have any Branch structure. If it does not then the whole of Section 8 together with the references to Branches in Section 9 should be deleted.

If the Local Party wishes to have a Branch structure then the provisions in 8.1 to 8.8 set out the necessary constitutional provisions. A Model Constitution for Branches is appended and should be followed, but may be varied by Branches with the agreement of the Local Party Executive.

8.5 contains a number of options for the financial arrangements of Branches.  Local Parties should decide which they want to adopt.  A Local Party could provide for one version to apply to some branches and another version to others. Either the Local Party may provide for Branch funds to be held by the Local Party Treasurer (first option 8.5) or to be held separately (second option 8.5) in which case the Branch must have a Treasurer and produce accounts.  Where the Local Party Treasurer holds Branch funds, they may be held as part of the funds of the Local Party (in which case the words in square brackets are retained).  The Branch then has no financial autonomy.  Alternatively, the Branch funds may be held by the Local Party Treasurer as a separate account (in which case the words in square brackets in the first version of 8.5 should be deleted). In default the first option applies with the words in square brackets retained.

9. Candidates and Elections

Most changes would conflict with the Federal Constitution. The Party Constitution and rules made by the Joint States Candidates Committee cover Parliamentary Candidate selection.  Regional Parties will make rules for the selection of candidates for Regional Government.  City/Borough/District Mayors are Local Government elections and Local Party Constitutions should make appropriate provision for the selection of Mayoral Candidates.  9.6 will apply where the Local Government area covers more than one Local Party.

The last sentence of 9.1 only applies to a Local Party covering more than one Constituency. Only one of the electoral college options, before or after the “/”, should then be included.

A Local Party should determine which method to use for local election candidate selection - a General Meeting or a postal ballot and whether the selection is to be done by only the members in the relevant electoral area, by all members of the Branch or by all members of the Local Party.  9.3 and 9.4 should then be adapted accordingly.  It is automatically provided that the Local Party undertakes the selection where there is no branch.  9.4 provides a minimum number of members for selections by electoral areas.  This provision is not needed when selection is by all members of the Local Party or all members of the Branch, when the relevant minimum numbers are specified in other provisions.

9.5 provides for the selection procedure when a selection has to be conducted at short notice, as is often the case for by-elections.  The Local Party should decide whether emergency selections are to be by the Branch Committee (where there is one) or by the Local Party Executive.

Section 9.7 should only be deleted if Local Parties find them inappropriate in local circumstances.

10. Finance

Most changes would conflict with the Federal Constitution and with the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

In 10.5 the Local Party may wish to provide for a Special General Meeting to be held reasonably soon after the financial year-end on 31st December to consider the annual accounts.  In that event at the end of this paragraph a date should be inserted, for example 28th February or 31st March.  The reference to the accounts being approved by the AGM in 7.2(b) should then be deleted, but not the references to a Treasurer’s report and budget.  Where Local Party accounts are required to be submitted to the Electoral Commission and published, where the Local Party’s gross income or total expenditure is over £25,000, early approval of the Accounts by a Special General Meeting is recommended.

The officers whose signatures are required to draw money might be specified more precisely in 10.7, especially if extra officers have been created.  No bank account should be operated on a single signature or by two members of the same family.

11. Constitution and Interpretation

None of the points in this section should be omitted.  Most changes would conflict with the Federal Constitution and rules made to ensure the Party’s compliance with the Political Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000.
